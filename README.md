In this assignment you will build upon the Noteful application that you started in the previous lesson. You will add two forms for POSTing new folders and new Notes to the server. You will also add error boundaries at appropriate places in the structure. Finally you will refactor the components to use PropTypes to validate the props.

Requirements

1)Create a new component AddFolder that implements a form to capture the name of a new folder from the user. This form should submit the name of the new folder to the POST /folders endpoint on the server. Ensure that any errors are properly handled. Add a button to the navigation to invoke the new form.

2)Create a new component AddNote that implements a form to capture the name, content and folder for a new Note. Submit to the POST /notes endpoint on the server. Add validation to ensure that the name of the note is not left blank. 
-The folder should be selected from a list of existing folders. 
-Ensure that errors are properly handled. Add a button to the note list page to invoke this new form.

3) Define an error boundary component. Add this component to specific points in your component structure.
Review each of the components that you have built so far for this project. Any component that receives props from its parent should be refactored to define PropType validation.













This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
